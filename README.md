# MultiTimer
A simple [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/) application that allows you to create and run multiple timers. It is implemented using the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) design pattern by leveraging the [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/) framework. The applications controls are styled the [Material Design In XAML](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/) toolkit.
